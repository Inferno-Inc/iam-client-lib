# Identity and Access Management (IAM) Client Library
A [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) library that provides high-level functions related to the identity and access management (IAM) for all users, [assets](./guides/asset.md), [organizations](./guides/organization.md) and [applications](./guides/application.md) that are anchored on the Energy Web Chain. 

### The IAM Client Library handles the following functions:
- [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/foundational-concepts/self-sovereign-identity#decentralized-identifiers-dids) management
- [Verifiable Credential (Claim)](https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/foundational-concepts/self-sovereign-identity#verifiable-credentials-vcs) requests, verification and issuance for role permissioning
- Management of [Switchboard](https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/technology/the-stack/application-layer/identity-management-applications#switchboard) namespaces
- Creation and governance of [organizations](./guides/organization.md), [applications](./guides/application.md), [assets](./guides/asset.md) and their associated roles
